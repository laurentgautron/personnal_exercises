""" Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
 Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in
 it and print out this new list. Write this in one line of Python. Ask the user for a number and return a list that
 contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user."""
